I used two different VMs to display the task one vm was running the elk stalk which will communicate with different host to gather logs.
The other vm was running a wordpress site and a filebeat containers which gathers the docker logs and forwardes the to elasticsearch. 
i have uploaded some screenshots of the running elk host also 

kibana1 and kibana2 both images shows that the elk was up running and was able to communicate with my host which had wordpress installed on it

the elasticsearch image shows that elasticsearch was running ans succesfuly installed on the host

and the dk_host_elk_host show that two different vms were running.
